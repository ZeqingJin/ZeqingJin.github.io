    <p>I am currently a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at UC Berkeley. My research area focuses on additive manufacturing, 3D-bioprinting, material design, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Although additive manufacturing technologies have made huge strides in the past decades, there are still challenges when it comes to defects that may occur during printing, influencing the part quality and reliability. These defects can often be reduced by optimizing the process parameter settings; conventional trial-and-error processes to do so, however, is inefficient and expensive. My research utilizes sensor technologies as well as machine learning algorithms to monitor and improve the printing process that includes anomaly detection and process parameter auto-correction. This real-time monitoring and autonomous correction system has been demonstrated in the fused filament fabrication method in my prior study and achieved satisfying results on anomaly recognition and process parameter auto-refining. This system powered with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms can be further utilized and applied to other manufacturing methods such as CNC machining, metal 3D-printing, and 3D-bioprinting to realize advanced autonomous manufacturing process without human interaction. Moreover, the methodology can effectively reduce material waste and achieve parts with higher quality needed for applications.</p>
<p>Feel free to contact me if you are interested in the research topics, <a href="https://gu.berkeley.edu">potential collaborations</a>, or maybe study &amp; life in UC Berkeley. Go bears!</p>
